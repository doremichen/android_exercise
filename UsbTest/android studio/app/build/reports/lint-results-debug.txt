E:\GitWorkSpace\android_exercise\UsbTest\android studio\app\build.gradle:25: Error: Version 28 (intended for Android Pie and below) is the last version of the legacy support library, so we recommend that you migrate to AndroidX libraries when using Android Q and moving forward. The IDE can help with this: Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX... [GradleCompatible]
    implementation 'com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.0'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleCompatible":
   There are some combinations of libraries, or tools and libraries, that are
   incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such incompatibility is compiling
   with a version of the Android support libraries that is not the latest
   version (or in particular, a version lower than your targetSdkVersion).

E:\GitWorkSpace\android_exercise\UsbTest\android studio\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

E:\GitWorkSpace\android_exercise\UsbTest\android studio\app\src\main\res\menu\main.xml:6: Warning: Attribute showAsAction is only used in API level 11 and higher (current min is 8) [UnusedAttribute]
        android:showAsAction="never"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedAttribute":
   This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a
   version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with
   the minSdkVersion attribute).

   This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute.
   However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality
   of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to
   achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can
   optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be
   used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer
   attribute.

   Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags
   can be unused too, such as the new <tag> element in layouts introduced in
   API 21.

E:\GitWorkSpace\android_exercise\UsbTest\android studio\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:18: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

E:\GitWorkSpace\android_exercise\UsbTest\android studio\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:8: Warning: This minSdkVersion value (8) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (8) [GradleOverrides]
        android:minSdkVersion="8"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E:\GitWorkSpace\android_exercise\UsbTest\android studio\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: This targetSdkVersion value (17) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (34) [GradleOverrides]
        android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleOverrides":
   The value of (for example) minSdkVersion is only used if it is not
   specified in the build.gradle build scripts. When specified in the Gradle
   build scripts, the manifest value is ignored and can be misleading, so
   should be removed to avoid ambiguity.
