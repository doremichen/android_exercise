E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:10: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\build.gradle:25: Warning: A newer version of com.android.support:support-v4 than 18.0.0 is available: 28.0.0 [GradleDependency]
    implementation 'com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.0'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: This minSdkVersion value (17) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (17) [GradleOverrides]
        android:minSdkVersion="17"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:10: Warning: This targetSdkVersion value (17) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (17) [GradleOverrides]
        android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleOverrides":
   The value of (for example) minSdkVersion is only used if it is not
   specified in the build.gradle build scripts. When specified in the Gradle
   build scripts, the manifest value is ignored and can be misleading, so
   should be removed to avoid ambiguity.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:6: Warning: Consider removing sharedUserId for new users by adding android:sharedUserMaxSdkVersion="32" to your manifest. See https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element for details. [Deprecated]
    android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system">
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Deprecated":
   Deprecated views, attributes and so on are deprecated because there is a
   better way to do something. Do it that new way. You've been warned.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:20: Warning: As of Android 12, android:exported must be set; use true to make the activity available to other apps, and false otherwise. [IntentFilterExportedReceiver]
        <receiver android:name=".BootUpReceiver">
         ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "IntentFilterExportedReceiver":
   Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit
   value for android:exported when the corresponding component has an intent
   filter defined. Otherwise, installation will fail. Set it to true to make
   this activity accessible to other apps, and false to limit it to be used
   only by this app or the OS. For launch activities, this should be set to
   true; otherwise, the app will fail to launch.

   Previously, android:exported for components without any intent filters
   present used to default to false, and when intent filters were present, the
   default was true. Defaults which change value based on other values are
   confusing and lead to apps accidentally exporting components as a
   side-effect of adding intent filters. This is a security risk, and we have
   made this change to avoid introducing accidental vulnerabilities.

   While the default without intent filters remains unchanged, it is now
   required to explicitly specify a value when intent filters are present. Any
   app failing to meet this requirement will fail to install on any Android
   version after Android 11.

   We recommend setting android:exported to false (even on previous versions
   of Android prior to this requirement) unless you have a good reason to
   export a particular component.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\build.gradle:10: Error: Google Play requires that apps target API level 31 or higher.
 [ExpiredTargetSdkVersion]
        targetSdkVersion 17
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ExpiredTargetSdkVersion":
   As of the second half of 2018, Google Play requires that new apps and app
   updates target API level 26 or higher.

   Configuring your app to target a recent API level ensures that users
   benefit from significant security and performance improvements, while still
   allowing your app to run on older Android versions (down to the
   minSdkVersion).

   To update your targetSdkVersion, follow the steps from "Meeting Google Play
   requirements for target API level",
   https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\src\main\res\values-v11: Warning: This folder configuration (v11) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 17. Merge all the resources in this folder into values. [ObsoleteSdkInt]
E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AppStartUp\app\src\main\res\values-v14: Warning: This folder configuration (v14) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 17. Merge all the resources in this folder into values. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.
