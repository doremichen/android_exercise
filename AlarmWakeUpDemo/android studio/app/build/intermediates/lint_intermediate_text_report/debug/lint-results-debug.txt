E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\build.gradle:10: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 33
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:19: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:8: Warning: This minSdkVersion value (14) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (14) [GradleOverrides]
        android:minSdkVersion="14"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: This targetSdkVersion value (17) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (33) [GradleOverrides]
        android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleOverrides":
   The value of (for example) minSdkVersion is only used if it is not
   specified in the build.gradle build scripts. When specified in the Gradle
   build scripts, the manifest value is ignored and can be misleading, so
   should be removed to avoid ambiguity.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\java\com\adam\app\alarmdemo\MainActivity.java:135: Warning: Missing PendingIntent mutability flag [UnspecifiedImmutableFlag]
     PendingIntent.FLAG_ONE_SHOT);
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnspecifiedImmutableFlag":
   Apps targeting Android 12 and higher must specify either FLAG_IMMUTABLE or
   FLAG_MUTABLE when constructing a PendingIntent.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\res\values-v11: Warning: This folder configuration (v11) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 14. Merge all the resources in this folder into values. [ObsoleteSdkInt]
E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\res\values-v14: Warning: This folder configuration (v14) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 14. Merge all the resources in this folder into values. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:18: Warning: Missing accessibility label: where minSdk < 17, you should provide an android:hint [LabelFor]
    <EditText
     ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LabelFor":
   Editable text fields should provide an android:hint or, provided your
   minSdkVersion is at least 17, they may be referenced by a view with a
   android:labelFor attribute.

   When using android:labelFor, be sure to provide an android:text or an
   android:contentDescription.

   If your view is labeled but by a label in a different layout which includes
   this one, just suppress this warning from lint.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AlarmWakeUpDemo\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:33: Warning: Hardcoded string "Start Alarm", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
        android:text="Start Alarm" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
