E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\build.gradle:25: Error: Version 28 (intended for Android Pie and below) is the last version of the legacy support library, so we recommend that you migrate to AndroidX libraries when using Android Q and moving forward. The IDE can help with this: Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX... [GradleCompatible]
    implementation 'com.android.support:support-v4:18.0.0'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleCompatible":
   There are some combinations of libraries, or tools and libraries, that are
   incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such incompatibility is compiling
   with a version of the Android support libraries that is not the latest
   version (or in particular, a version lower than your targetSdkVersion).

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\java\com\adam\app\Utils.java:81: Error: Tag name should use a unique prefix followed by a colon (found MyLock). For instance myapp:mywakelocktag. This will help with debugging [InvalidWakeLockTag]
            PowerManager.WakeLock wl = pm.newWakeLock(PowerManager.FULL_WAKE_LOCK
                                       ^

   Explanation for issues of type "InvalidWakeLockTag":
   Wake Lock tags must follow the naming conventions defined in
   the`PowerManager` documentation.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:10: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:13: Error: Permission is only granted to system apps [ProtectedPermissions]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INJECT_EVENTS" />
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ProtectedPermissions":
   Permissions with the protection level signature, privileged or
   signatureOrSystem are only granted to system apps. If an app is a regular
   non-system app, it will never be able to use these permissions.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:22: Warning: Redundant label can be removed [RedundantLabel]
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "RedundantLabel":
   When an activity does not have a label attribute, it will use the one from
   the application tag. Since the application has already specified the same
   label, the label on this activity can be omitted.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:9: Warning: This minSdkVersion value (17) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (17) [GradleOverrides]
        android:minSdkVersion="17"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:10: Warning: This targetSdkVersion value (17) is not used; it is always overridden by the value specified in the Gradle build script (34) [GradleOverrides]
        android:targetSdkVersion="17" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleOverrides":
   The value of (for example) minSdkVersion is only used if it is not
   specified in the build.gradle build scripts. When specified in the Gradle
   build scripts, the manifest value is ignored and can be misleading, so
   should be removed to avoid ambiguity.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:6: Warning: Consider removing sharedUserId for new users by adding android:sharedUserMaxSdkVersion="32" to your manifest. See https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element for details. [Deprecated]
    android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system">
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Deprecated":
   Deprecated views, attributes and so on are deprecated because there is a
   better way to do something. Do it that new way. You've been warned.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:36: Warning: Exported receiver does not require permission [ExportedReceiver]
        <receiver
         ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ExportedReceiver":
   Exported receivers (receivers which either set exported=true or contain an
   intent-filter and do not specify exported=false) should define a permission
   that an entity must have in order to launch the receiver or bind to it.
   Without this, any application can use this receiver.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\java\com\adam\app\Test.java:30: Warning: Missing PendingIntent mutability flag [UnspecifiedImmutableFlag]
        mPendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(ctx, 0, it, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);
                                                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnspecifiedImmutableFlag":
   Apps targeting Android 12 and higher must specify either FLAG_IMMUTABLE or
   FLAG_MUTABLE when constructing a PendingIntent.

   https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#pending-intent-mutability

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\res\values-v11: Warning: This folder configuration (v11) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 17. Merge all the resources in this folder into values. [ObsoleteSdkInt]
E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\res\values-v14: Warning: This folder configuration (v14) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 17. Merge all the resources in this folder into values. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\res\values\strings.xml:5: Warning: The resource R.string.hello_world appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
    <string name="hello_world">Hello world!</string>
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

E:\AndroidStudioProjects\AutoWakeUp\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml:18: Warning: Missing accessibility label: provide either a view with an android:labelFor that references this view or provide an android:hint [LabelFor]
    <EditText
     ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "LabelFor":
   Editable text fields should provide an android:hint or, provided your
   minSdkVersion is at least 17, they may be referenced by a view with a
   android:labelFor attribute.

   When using android:labelFor, be sure to provide an android:text or an
   android:contentDescription.

   If your view is labeled but by a label in a different layout which includes
   this one, just suppress this warning from lint.
